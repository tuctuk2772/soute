In order to properly run this code, you need to download and install both the free DOTween Unity plugin:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676?srsltid=AfmBOorDPFLSyc4qOreEUL02L2mGmF7Hm6g1LSQk1zfC8oW4xHeWN5i0

If you go to Windows -> Package Management -> Package Manager, you should see a search bar where you can find DOTween under My Assets, download and import that into this project to see the code run most effectively.
